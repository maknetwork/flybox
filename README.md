<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


Originally built for a fly farmer. This helps you to automate fly farming and also monitor and schedule tasks using a web interface. 

Here's are some advantages:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing and not on openining and closing doors on a flybox.
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over.
* Fly farming can lead to diseases.


A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.
